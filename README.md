# Reinforcement Learning Algorithms
This repository contains coursework from my graduate reinforcement learning course at UMass.
CMPSCI687_RLEnvs.py contains my implementation of Cartpole, Mountian Car, anda gridworld enviornment. 
rl_algorithms.py contains my implmentation of the following algorithms with and without function approximation. All function approximation methods used linear function approximation with the Fourier Basis
* TD Learning
* Q Learning 
* SARSA
* Q(lambda)
* SARSA(lambda)
* Actor Critic
* REINFORCE
* Black Box Algorithms
  * Cross Entropy Policy Search
  * First Choice Hill Climbing
